# Change-Making-Problem
The change making problem adresses the question of finding the minimum number of a given allowed set of coins required to make a certain
target ammount. For most widley used coin systems, simple algorithms like the greedy algorithm (which continually adds the largest allowed 
coin that can be added without exceeding the target) are sufficient, but the goal here is to provide an algorithm which works for any 
arbitrary coin system.
